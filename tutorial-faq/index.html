<h1>Tutorial</h1>
Hello and welcome to the guidebook for IdleRPG Bot. This bot is mainly focused around an adventure-styled game. 
To get started, you will first need to make a character. Type <span>$create</span> to do so.<br>
After that, it will ask you to pick a name. Type a name. You do not need to include the prefix; if you do, it will be part of your name. For example:<br>
<span>$create</span><br>
<span>$Zell</span><br>
The above will name my character <span>$Zell</span> so you do not need to include the prefix.<br>
If you mess up the naming of your character, you can do <span>$rename</span> for no cost.<br><br>

After that, you will start with $100 and some starter equipment (3 Atk/Def), so you will be pretty limited on what you can do.<br>
Type <span>$adventures</span> to list all the adventures, and you will probably want to start with the first one, so type <span>$adventure 1</span> (Or <span>$a 1</span> to shorten it), and your character will embark on the adventure.<br>
You can type <span>$status</span> (Or <span>$s</span>) to check on the status; you will need this command to complete the adventure when finished.<br>
Every adventure takes time, the harder the difficulty, the more time it takes. The first one takes 30 minutes. Once the adventure is finished, the bot will calculate your success chances and you will either succeed on the mission or fail. If you succeed, you will receive money, experience, and a random piece of equipment. If you fail, you get nothing. Just embark on another adventure!<br><br>

There are many ways to make money, you earn some from the adventures, you can sell your unwanted equipment (type <span>$inventory</span> or <span>$i</span> to see your inventory, this lists all items, their IDs, stats, and market value), if you want to put an item for sale to other players, type <span>$sell id price</span> and the item will be placed on the market. If you want to sell the item instantly for its value, type <span>$merch id</span> and you will receive the value.<br>
You can also gamble! You can flip a coin to win (or lose) money. The command is <span>$flip heads/tails amount</span>, and at the moment there is no limit on how much you can bet. The chances are 50/50 and if you win, you receive the amount you bet, if you lose, you lose it.<br>
There is also a <span>$bet</span> command where the bot will guess a number between <span>1</span> and the maximum you define (has to be at least 2), and if you guessed that number, you win the amount you bet.
<br>For example:<br>
<span>$bet 2 1 500</span> - Starts a bet. The bot will guess a number between 1 and 2, and if it is 1, you win $500.<br><br>

You can also battle people for money. The command is <span>$battle amount</span>. If you want to battle a specific player, you can mention a user after the amount to battle for. The battle is handled by adding each combatant’s Atk, Def, and then adding a random number between 1-7 to each combatant, and whoever is higher, wins. If both are equal, it randomizes the winner. The winner receives the prize money.
